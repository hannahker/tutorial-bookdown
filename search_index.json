We must now manually code the personal comments data according to their theme and direction of impact on anxiety levels. 3.1 Coding according to theme Manually perform the following steps: Read through all comments and record, in one word, the primary theme that emerges from each comment. Group together similar themes. For each group of themes, identify the higher-level theme (again, in one word). 3.2 Coding according to direction of impact on anxiety Manually perform the following steps: Read through all comments and classify the overall sentiment as positive or negative. Following this process, the personal comments data will look something like this: ## Date_time ## 1 2019-12-04 13:58 ## 2 2019-12-04 13:59 ## 3 2019-12-04 19:11 ## 4 2019-12-04 19:15 ## 5 2019-12-05 11:31 ## 6 2019-12-05 18:52 ## Ã¯..Note.x ## 1 There are some bikes moving very quickly here ## 2 This park looks very peaceful ## 3 Still haven&#39;t gotten the hang of looking a different way when crossing the street ## 4 It&#39;s nice not to see any cars in here ## 5 Almost didn&#39;t see that car coming around the corner ## 6 The pedestrian scale of this street is really comfortable ## Theme Sentiment X_coord Y_coord hr ## 1 Traffic Negative -0.1263700 51.52482 130 ## 2 Nature Positive -0.1274354 51.52488 129 ## 3 Traffic Negative -0.1323954 51.52330 124 ## 4 Traffic Positive -0.1323954 51.52330 124 ## 5 Traffic Negative -0.1249467 51.52490 140 ## 6 Visuals Positive -0.1184381 51.52405 109 "]
